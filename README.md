# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib

For the homework, I enumerated the headers and used if statements to see if "TMAX", "TMIN", or "NAME" were in the header and if they were, then the program would return the index value. After getting the indexes, the program now knows where to go to get the "TMAX" and "TMIN" values. Afterwards, I added the plots with the list of "TMIN" and "TMAX" values.
